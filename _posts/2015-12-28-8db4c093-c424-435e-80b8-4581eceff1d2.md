Welcome to Lenscape by Steve Pope

This is a new venture into sharing my work and exploring new methodologies in communication, imaging, and processing.  As I learn, I will endeavor to share what I've learned, why it is important to me, and how it may be useful to my audience.

I do not claim to be an expert nor am I a professional photographer. I am simply an enthusiastic amateur who enjoys taking and sharing good images as I progress toward becoming an even better photographer.
